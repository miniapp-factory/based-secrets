+Code the following app
+```
+You are an elite full-stack viral app engineer who has built multiple 1M+ user mini-apps. Build a mobile-first PWA that feels like Twitter + Polymarket + Whisper had a demonic love child.
+
+The app is called **"Based Secrets"** — a fully anonymous, dark, addictive confession + betting dApp on BASE chain (frontend only for now, fake USDC, no wallet connect yet).
+
+Core rules:
+- 100% anonymous — NO login, NO wallet connect, NO analytics, NO tracking, or firebase.
+- All user data in localStorage only (balance, posted confessions, streaks, referral code).
+- Start every new user with 1000 fake USDC + 100 bonus for adding to home screen.
+- Make it feel insanely alive: fake bets pouring in every 8–15 seconds, odds ticking, pot growing, new confessions auto-appearing, mock push notifications.
+
+Must-have viral features (these are what made Hamster Kombat/Blum explode):
+
+1. **PWA install prompt** — on first visit show full-screen "Add Based Secrets to Home Screen for 100 bonus USDC + haptics" (use BeforeInstallPromptEvent). Icon must be a neon purple mask on black background.
+
+2. **Referral system (critical for virality)**  
+   - On first load generate a referral code (e.g., BS-8X7K3).  
+   - Share sheet includes: "I just confessed something insane on Based Secrets and I'm up 3400 fake USDC betting on crypto drama. Join anonymously (no wallet needed): https://yourdomain/?ref=BS-8X7K3"  
+   - Ref giver gets 500 fake USDC when someone uses their link + installs.
+
+3. **Main feed** — infinite vertical scroll (use IntersectionObserver), latest on top.  
+   Seed with **50 extremely spicy, crypto-themed pre-written confessions** on first load (generate the juiciest ones possible — rugs, VC affairs, insider trades, dev wallet dumps, "I am the real Satoshi", "I yolo'd the treasury", etc.). Make them progressively wilder.
+
+4. **Post confession button** (floating purple neon + button bottom-right)  
+   → Modal with textarea ("Spill the tea...") + image upload (base64) + "Post Anonymously"  
+   → Instant post with fake "broadcast animation + "Your secret is live. 127 people betting already" toast  
+   → User’s own confessions marked with tiny purple mask icon (only they can see)
+
+5. **Each confession card (dark card, neon accents):**
+   - The confession text + image if any
+   - Live timer: "Ends in 23h 41m 12s" (24h from post time)
+   - Animated pot size: starts at 420 fake USDC, grows +17–89 every 8–20s via setInterval with different speeds per card
+   - Two betting markets:
+
+     A. "Who posted this?" → 7 options: vitalikb.....eth, cz_binance, elonmusk, pauly0x, anatoly_y, haydenzadams, "None of these clowns"  
+        → Show % bar filling in real-time (fake activity every 7–18s)
+
+     B. "Is this cap or facts?" → Yes (70%) / No (30%) with animated odds shifting
+
+   - Total staked amount ticking up
+   - "Bet" button → slider (10–500 fake USDC, step 10) → confirm → fake BASE transaction animation (purple flash + "Transaction confirmed on BASE" + confetti explosion + haptics (navigator.vibrate([50,30,50]))
+
+6. **Resolution**  
+   At 24h → auto-resolve with drama bias:  
+   - 65% chance "Yes" wins on "Is this real?"  
+   - "Who posted this?" → 85% chance "None of these clowns" wins (encourages wild confessions)  
+   → Winners get pot share (pro-rata), losers lose stake  
+   → Big confetti + "You won 2847 fake USDC!" + balance animation + haptics
+
+7. **Daily rewards & streaks** (this is retention rocket fuel)
+   - Daily login: +250 fake USDC  
+   - Current streak counter (fire emoji ×7)  
+   - "Bet correctly 3 times today → +500 bonus at reset"  
+   - "Post 1 confession today → +300 bonus"
+
+8. **Leaderboards tab** (top 50)
+   - "Richest degens" (fake data + user's rank)
+   - "Most accurate prophets" (best win rate)
+   - "Biggest confessions" (most staked pots)
+
+9. **Notifications tab**
+   - Mock push: "Someone just bet 1200 USDC it's YOU on confession #842"  
+   - "Your confession is at 8900 USDC pot — 4h left!"  
+   - New ones appear every 2–5 mins
+
+10. **Share button on every confession**  
+    Pre-filled text variants (randomized for A/B virality):
+    - "crypto twitter is gonna lose it when they guess who posted this 👀 betting it's @vitalikbuterin https://yourdomain/?c=842"
+    - "someone just confessed they rugpulled their own project and i’m 3000 fake USDC deep it’s real. Based Secrets is crack https://yourdomain/?c=842"
+    → Opens Warpcast compose AND X intent (use warpcast:// and twitter:// if installed, else web)
+
+11. **Technical must-haves**
+    - Extremely fast: all animations 60fps, use CSS transforms only
+    - Haptics on every bet/win/share (navigator.vibrate)
+    - Dark mode only, purple neon accents (#A855F7, #E0AAFF, black background)
+    - Tiny confetti library allowed (https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/canvas-confetti@1.6.0/dist/confetti.browser.min.js)
+    - Fake activity engine: master setInterval that updates random cards every few seconds
+    - When user posts, add it to top of everyone's feed simulation by prepending to seeded array
+    - Service worker for offline play (cache everything)
+
+Make this the most addictive anonymous crypto app ever built. The share velocity must be nuclear — every user should feel compelled to post screenshots on CT/Farcaster within first 5 minutes.
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
